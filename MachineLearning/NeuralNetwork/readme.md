Key Observations from the Results (NN2.py):
- Decreasing Training Loss: The training loss consistently decreases, nearing zero by the end of 500 epochs. This suggests that the model is effectively learning to fit the training data, achieving a high degree of accuracy in terms of how well it can predict the training targets.
- Increasing Validation Loss: Despite the training loss decreasing, the validation loss starts to increase after some initial epochs. This pattern is a strong indication of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data, i.e., the model is too closely fit to the training data and not generalizing well to unseen data.

What This Means:
- Generalization Issue: The model is not generalizing well to unseen data, indicated by the increasing validation loss. While it learns to predict the training data nearly perfectly, its predictions for new, unseen data (validation data) are becoming progressively worse.

Recommendations to Address Overfitting: (not cover)
- Regularization: Introduce regularization methods such as L2 regularization (weight decay), or dropout if there are more complex layers or a deeper network.
- Early Stopping: Stop training as soon as the validation loss begins to increase consistently, even though the training loss is still decreasing. This can prevent the model from learning the noise and specific details of the training set.
- Model Complexity: Simplify the model if possible. Sometimes, smaller or simpler models can generalize better.
- Cross-Validation: Instead of a single validation set, use cross-validation to ensure that the model’s performance assessment is robust and not dependent on the way data is split.
- Data Augmentation: If applicable, increase the diversity of the training data through augmentation techniques. This helps in improving the model’s ability to generalize.
- Feature Engineering: Revisit the input features to ensure they are representative of the problem and do not include misleading information or noise.
